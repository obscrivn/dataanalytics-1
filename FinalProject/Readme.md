# ANLY 506 Final Project: Bike Vendors EDA Project

## Introduction

This is a readme file for the final project in my ANLY 506 class for the Spring 2019 semester.

Through this project, I am seeking to demonstrate mastery of some of the exploratory data analysis concepts and tools which I have learned over the course of the semester while taking the ANLY 506 - Exploratory Data Analysis course.

In this project, I will be conducting an exploratory data analysis of the bike vendors dataset as provided by the Professor. 

## Data

The Bike Vendors data set contains information about the share of sales for different models and types of bikes sold by different bike vendors. The data set is provided in a csv file which contains 97 observations of 35 variables.
