# ANLY 506 Final Project Readme file

## Bike Vendors EDA Project

### Introduction

This is a readme file for the final project in my ANLY 506 class for the Spring of 2019 semester.

Through this project, I am seeking to demonstrate mastery of some of the exploratory data analysis concepts and tools which I have learned over the semester, while taking the ANLY 506 - Exploratory Data Analysis course.

In this project, I will be conducting an exploratory data analysis of the bike vendors dataset as provided by the Professor. 

### Data

The Bike Vendors data set contains information about the sales of different models and types of bikes by different vendors. The data set is provided in a csv file which contains 97 observations of 35 variables.
